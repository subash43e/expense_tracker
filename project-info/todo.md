# Project To-Do List

This file tracks all user requests and tasks for the project. For every new user request, add a new to-do item, update status as work progresses, and mark as completed when done.

## To-Do Format
- Each to-do should include: request summary, date, status (`not-started`, `in-progress`, `completed`), and any relevant details or links.
- Always review this file before starting new work.
- Complete tasks one by one, updating status immediately after each step.

## Example Entry

**Status:** completed
**Details:** See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for output.

# Instructions for AI Agent To-Do Workflow

- For every user request, create a new to-do file in `project-info/` using `todo-template.md` as a base. Name the file with the date and a short description (e.g., `todo-2025-10-30-add-auth.md`).
- Add a summary entry and link to each new to-do file in this main `todo.md` file.
- Always check this file before starting any new work.
- Mark only one to-do as `in-progress` at a time; update status as soon as a task is completed.
- Store relevant chat details or links in the Details field for each to-do.
- Complete tasks sequentially, never batch mark as completed.
- Use the format provided in the template for consistency.
- This workflow ensures all requests are tracked, visible, and completed methodically.
